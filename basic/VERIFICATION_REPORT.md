## Status: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED

All deliverables have been created and tested successfully.

## Deliverables

### 1. generate_headlines.py
- **Status:** Complete
- **Purpose:** Generates synthetic news headlines dataset
- **Output:** 400 headlines across 4 categories (Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment)
- **Features:**
  - Template-based generation with randomization
  - Balanced dataset (100 headlines per category)
  - Includes metadata: word_count, has_number

### 2. news_headlines_dataset.csv
- **Status:** Complete
- **Rows:** 400
- **Columns:** headline_id, headline, category, word_count, has_number
- **Categories:** Politics (100), Sports (100), Technology (100), Entertainment (100)
- **Verified:** Dataset loads correctly and has expected structure

### 3. nlp_basics_homework.ipynb
- **Status:** Complete and Tested
- **Structure:** 11 sections (as per requirements)
- **Format:** Mix of COMPLETED examples and TODO exercises

#### Section Breakdown:
1. **Introduction & Data Loading (COMPLETED)** - Import libraries, load data
2. **Exploring the Data (TODO)** - Category counts, bar chart, average word count
3. **Text Basics (COMPLETED)** - Lowercase, tokenization, word counting
4. **Working with All Headlines (TODO)** - Create lowercase column, find longest/shortest
5. **Word Frequency - Introduction (COMPLETED)** - Count 'the', 'and', 'in'
6. **Most Common Words (TODO)** - Use Counter, create bar chart
7. **Words by Category (COMPLETED)** - Example with Sports category
8. **Compare Categories (TODO)** - Compare all 4 categories
9. **Simple Visualization (TODO)** - Histogram, pie chart, number analysis
10. **Text Patterns (TODO - BONUS)** - Search for keywords, patterns
11. **Summary Questions** - Reflection questions

#### Critical Fixes Applied:
- **Fix 1:** Section 5 now uses inline `.str.lower()` instead of depending on `headline_lower` column from TODO Section 4
- **Fix 2:** Counter imported at the top (cell-2) so it's available for Section 7 (COMPLETED)
- **Fix 3:** Section 5 now counts correct words: 'the', 'and', 'in' (per requirements)
- **Fix 4:** Section 7 uses inline `.str.lower()` for Sports headlines

#### Verification Results:
```
=== Section 1: Loading Data ===
Dataset shape: (400, 5)
Columns: ['headline_id', 'headline', 'category', 'word_count', 'has_number']
PASS

=== Section 3: Text Basics ===
Original: machine learning market expected to grow 15 percent
Lowercase: machine learning market expected to grow 15 percent
Words: 8
PASS

=== Section 5: Word Frequency ===
Total characters: 19799
Total words: 2855
Count of 'the': 26
Count of 'and': 23
Count of 'in': 76
PASS

=== Section 7: Words by Category ===
Number of Sports headlines: 100
Top 10 words in Sports: ['in', 'with', 'to', 'bulls', 'secures', 'playoff', 'spot', 'win', 'over', 'victory']
PASS
```

### 4. nlp_basics_solutions.ipynb
- **Status:** Complete and Updated
- **Purpose:** Instructor reference with all solutions
- **Features:**
  - All TODO sections completed with solutions
  - Sample answers to reflection questions
  - Additional analysis examples (word count distributions, summary statistics)
  - Same critical fixes applied for consistency
