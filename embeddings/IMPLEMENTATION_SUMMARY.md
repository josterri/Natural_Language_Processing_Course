## Key Features

### 1. Embedding Generation (`generate_embeddings.py`)
- Loads extended headlines dataset (10,000 headlines)
- Uses sentence-transformers model: **all-MiniLM-L6-v2**
- Generates 384-dimensional embeddings
- Saves embeddings as NumPy array (~15 MB)
- Saves metadata (headlines, categories) as JSON
- Shows progress and statistics

**Model Choice:**
- **Fast**: ~500 sentences/second on CPU
- **Small**: ~80 MB model size
- **Quality**: Excellent for semantic similarity
- **Easy**: Pre-trained, no setup needed

### 2. Semantic Search (`semantic_search.py`)
- Interactive or command-line interface
- Searches by meaning, not just keywords
- Returns top-k most similar headlines
- Shows similarity scores (0-1 range)
- Displays category for each result

**Example:**
```bash
python semantic_search.py --query "president announces new policy" --top-k 5
```

Finds:
- "chancellor brown inaugurated with promise..."
- "prime minister davis inaugurated with promise..."
- Even though "chancellor" and "prime minister" are different words!

### 3. Similarity Analysis (`similarity_demo.py`)
Comprehensive analysis including:
- Pairwise similarities between sample headlines
- Within-category vs between-category similarities
- Most similar and dissimilar pairs
- Nearest neighbors for specific headlines

**Key Finding:**
- Within-category similarity: ~0.62
- Between-category similarity: ~0.46
- Headlines in the same category are ~35% more similar!

### 4. Interactive Notebook (`embedding_analysis.ipynb`)

## How to Use

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to embeddings folder
cd embeddings/

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Generate embeddings (takes 1-2 minutes)
python generate_embeddings.py

# 2. Try semantic search
python semantic_search.py --interactive

# 3. Analyze similarities
python similarity_demo.py

# 4. Open notebook for visualization
jupyter notebook embedding_analysis.ipynb
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Generate embeddings** once (stores for reuse)
2. **Explore with semantic search** (try different queries)
3. **Analyze patterns** with similarity_demo.py
4. **Deep dive** with the interactive notebook
5. **Experiment** with your own modifications

## Practical Applications

### 1. Semantic Search Engine
Build a search that understands meaning:
- Query: "team victory"
- Finds: "Phoenix wins championship", "Galaxy defeats United"

### 2. Content Recommendation
Recommend similar articles:
- User reads: "AI breakthroughs"
- Recommend: "machine learning advances", "neural network research"

### 3. Duplicate Detection
Find near-duplicates:
- "President announces new law"
- "President unveils new legislation"
- Similarity > 0.9 → likely duplicate

### 4. Text Classification
Use embeddings as features:
- Extract 384-dimensional embedding
- Train simple classifier (logistic regression)
- Often better than bag-of-words

### 5. Clustering and Topic Discovery
Group similar content:
- No predefined categories needed
- Discover natural groupings
- Visualize with t-SNE

## Key Concepts Explained

### Embeddings
Numerical representations (vectors) that capture semantic meaning:
- Similar meanings → similar vectors
- Mathematical operations → meaningful transformations

### Cosine Similarity
Measures angle between vectors:
```
similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```
- 1.0 = identical direction (very similar)
- 0.5 = 60-degree angle (moderately similar)
- 0.0 = orthogonal (unrelated)

### Dimensionality Reduction
**PCA**: Linear, fast, finds maximum variance directions
**t-SNE**: Non-linear, preserves local structure, reveals clusters

### Semantic vs Keyword Search
**Keyword**: Exact word matching only
**Semantic**: Understands meaning and context

## Expected Results

### Performance
- **Embedding generation**: ~20 seconds for 10,000 headlines
- **Semantic search**: <1ms per query (with pre-computed embeddings)
- **t-SNE visualization**: 2-3 minutes for 2000 samples

### Quality
- **Within-category similarity**: 0.60-0.65
- **Between-category similarity**: 0.45-0.50
- **Search relevance**: High (captures semantic meaning)
- **Clustering**: Clear category separation in visualizations
