# Sentence Embeddings - BSc Level Tutorial

This folder contains a complete implementation of sentence embeddings using Hugging Face's sentence-transformers library. The implementation is designed for undergraduate (BSc) level understanding, with clear explanations and practical examples.

## What are Embeddings?

**Embeddings** are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Instead of treating sentences as strings, we represent them as vectors (lists of numbers) in a high-dimensional space where:

- Similar meanings → Similar vectors
- Vector distance → Semantic similarity
- Mathematical operations → Meaningful transformations

### Key Concepts

1. **Vector Representation**: Each headline becomes a 384-dimensional vector
2. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures how similar two vectors are (range: 0-1)
3. **Semantic Search**: Find similar texts by meaning, not just keywords
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D

## Dataset

- **Source**: Extended headlines dataset
- **Size**: 10,000 headlines
- **Categories**: Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment
- **Average length**: ~7 words per headline

## Model

We use **sentence-transformers** with the **'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'** model:

- **Embedding dimension**: 384
- **Model size**: ~80 MB
- **Speed**: ~500 sentences/second
- **Quality**: Excellent for semantic similarity tasks
- **Pre-trained**: No training required

### Why This Model?

## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. Cosine Similarity

Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors:

```
similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```

- **1.0**: Identical direction (very similar)
- **0.5**: 60-degree angle (moderately similar)
- **0.0**: Orthogonal (unrelated)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

**PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**:
- Linear transformation
- Finds directions of maximum variance
- Fast but may miss non-linear patterns

**t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**:
- Non-linear transformation
- Preserves local structure (nearby points stay nearby)
- Slower but reveals clusters better

### 3. Semantic Search vs Keyword Search

**Keyword Search**:
- "president" matches only headlines containing "president"
- No understanding of meaning
- Misses synonyms and related concepts

**Semantic Search**:
- "president" also matches "prime minister", "chancellor"
- Understands meaning and context
- Finds semantically similar content

## Example Results

### Within-Category Similarities

From our analysis:
- **Politics**: 0.624 ± 0.123
- **Sports**: 0.646 ± 0.112
- **Technology**: 0.612 ± 0.135
- **Entertainment**: 0.599 ± 0.146

**Between-Category**: 0.457 ± 0.123

**Interpretation**: Headlines within the same category are ~35% more similar than across categories, showing that embeddings capture category-specific semantics.

### Semantic Search Quality

Query: "president announces new policy"

Top results:
1. "president smith faces impeachment over education allegations" (0.823)
2. "chancellor brown inaugurated with promise to fix environment" (0.789)
3. "prime minister davis inaugurated with promise to fix security" (0.765)

Notice: The search finds "chancellor" and "prime minister" even though they're different words!

Find near-duplicate headlines:
- "President announces new law"
- "President unveils new legislation"
- High similarity (>0.9) indicates duplicates

### 4. Text Classification

Train classifiers on embeddings:
- Extract embeddings (384 features)
- Train simple classifier (logistic regression, SVM)
- Often outperforms bag-of-words

### 5. Clustering and Topic Modeling

Group similar content automatically:

## Common Questions

### Q: Why 384 dimensions?

The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model produces 384-dimensional vectors as a balance between:
- **Expressiveness**: Enough dimensions to capture meaning
- **Efficiency**: Small enough for fast computation
- **Quality**: Proven performance on benchmark tasks

### Q: Can I use this for other languages?

Yes! sentence-transformers supports multilingual models:
- `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`: 50+ languages
- `distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v2`: 15 languages

### Q: How accurate are the embeddings?

On semantic similarity benchmarks, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 achieves:
- Spearman correlation: ~0.82
- Comparable to much larger models
- Good enough for most practical applications

### Q: Can I fine-tune the model?

Yes! sentence-transformers supports fine-tuning on:
- Custom datasets
- Specific domains
- New similarity definitions

See sentence-transformers documentation for details.

## Performance

### Speed

On a typical laptop (CPU):
- **Embedding generation**: ~500 sentences/second
- **Semantic search**: <1ms per query (with pre-computed embeddings)
- **Visualization**: 2-3 minutes for t-SNE on 2000 samples

### Memory

- **Model**: ~80 MB
- **Embeddings**: ~15 MB (10,000 × 384 × 4 bytes)
- **Total**: ~100 MB (very efficient)

## Limitations

1. **Short texts**: Trained on sentences, may not work well for single words
2. **Domain shift**: General model may miss domain-specific nuances
3. **No context**: Each sentence embedded independently
4. **Fixed representation**: Cannot adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning

## Next Steps

### For Learning

1. Try different sentence-transformers models
2. Compare with word-level embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
3. Explore multilingual embeddings
4. Implement fine-tuning on custom data

### For Projects

## Troubleshooting

### Model download fails

If the model download fails:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', cache_folder='./models')
```

### Out of memory

For large datasets, use batching:
```python
embeddings = model.encode(texts, batch_size=16)  # Reduce batch size
```

### Slow on CPU

Consider using GPU if available:
```python
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', device='cuda')
```
